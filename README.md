# A(udio)FileTransfer

You ever need to send a file to multiple devices at once and didn't want to use LAN or the internet.

Well now you can with AFileTransfer! Using a two tone system that outputs all the bits and bops of a file to your speaker and allows another device to listen to those for file transferring.

Currently it does it bit by bit, but future improvements include a compression key and algorithm to be able to quickly send the files back and forth.
